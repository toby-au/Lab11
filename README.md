# Pokemon Card Game

Pokemon Card game: each player gets a random deck of 15 cards, select which strategy to use and returns the winners ID

Poke-lightning utilizes the two files array_heap and rit.lib 

It generates two decks of 15 cards, each card containing the Pokemon name and it's stats based on the file pokedex.txt

There are 6 strategies to choose from: Minimum Health Points, Max HP, Min Attack, Max ATK, Min BOTH, Max BOTH

After selecting which strategy to use for both Player 1 and Player 2, the algorithm will print out the cards in both decks and then generate the game play as text and finally displays the winner of the match up.
